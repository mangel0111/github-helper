##### Github Helper

### The Challenge

Imagine you have to work in the the following scenario:
_Our customer support team have to interact with the Github issues search throughout the day. They're put off by typing queries and would much rather an interactive query builder that hides the actual query from them.
Can you come up with a design that allows our customer support team to search GitHub issues in a more point-and-click, user-friendly way that doesn't involve typing complex queries?
For the purpose of this exercise imagine that they are interested in all the filter parameters the API offers (author, labels, status, and so on)._

You will be building it as a Single-Page Application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can find the documentation for the Github API here: https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/

The most important feature the app has to include is a logic filter for the list of Github issues that scopes the results based on the query parameters.
